DDSharp
DirectDraw Surface image file reader library and a simple proof-of-concept viewer.
I couldn't find a decent DDS library for .NET (not without a whole lot of baggage anyway), so I decided to do the legwork and implement it from the ground up. Plus, working with binary files is fun for me (I'm weird like that).
